# Face Mask Detection ðŸ˜·

This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It can be used in real-time scenarios such as workplaces, public entrances, or surveillance systems to monitor mask compliance.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects faces in images and video streams
- Classifies faces as **Mask** or **No Mask**
- Real-time webcam support (via OpenCV)
- Trained using Keras with TensorFlow backend
- Utilizes Haar Cascade for face detection

---

## ðŸ§  Model Details

- Multiple `.keras` models trained on a labeled dataset with `mask` and `no_mask` categories
- Accuracy and performance vary per model (e.g., `model-001.keras`, `model-002.keras`)
- One sample model (`model-001.keras`) included
- Full set of models can be provided on request
